# Disaster-Tweets-Detection
This is an application project of NLP to predict which Tweets are about real disasters and which
ones are not. In addition to daily social interaction, Twitter can also be used to predict disasters.
Therefore, this predicted information will help relevant agencies to monitor and take measures. In
this project, we will use general NLP methods to pre-process the tweets text data, and then use
different RNN models to predict whether it is a real disaster and try to use ways to improve the
accuracy of the prediction. At the end, we will compare the effectiveness and efficiency of different
models.

This is an ongoing competition on Kaggle. According to reports, Twitter has become an important communication
channel in times of crisis. Smartphones are ubiquitous, allowing people to announce emergencies that they are observ-
ing in real time. Therefore, more organizations are interested in programmatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster
relief organizations and news organizations). Therefore, such predictions become very important. In this project, the
challenge is to predict which Tweets are about real disasters and which oneâ€™s are not.
